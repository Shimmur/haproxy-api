Contributing
============

Contributions are more than welcome. Bug reports with specific reproduction steps
are great. If you have a code contribution you'd like to make, open a pull request
with suggested code.

Pull requests should:

* Clearly state their intent in the title
* Have a description that explains the need for the changes
* Include tests!
* Not break the public API

Ping us to let us know you're working on something interesting by opening a GitHub
Issue on the project.
